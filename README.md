# PORTFOLIO

This week's project was to create a portfolio based on a given design from FIGMA. The website is built on HTML, CSS and the focus has been on web accessibility.

I have also added vanilla JavaScript manipulating the DOM and using the toggle method to make possible for the user to chose the mode of the header, between day mode or night mode.
